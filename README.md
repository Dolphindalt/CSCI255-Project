# CSCI 255 - Intro to Embedded System Project

## Introduction

My name is Dalton Caron and I am the primary author of this software. Two other
teams members aided me slightly. I decided to program a rover so that I could
control it with a Nintendo Game Cube controller. Speakers were attached to the
rover to add a third domain to accomodate three project members. In the end,
this may have not been needed but it was a fun feature to present to the class.
By far, the Game Cube controller was the most difficult section to program. I
did not track how long I did debugging and double checking, but it took me
about a week to realize I was not reading inputs properly. I will never forget
this project and it will always hold a special place in my heart. Although I
do not have the friends I created this with anymore, I will treasure their
memory and continue to move forward, even in the face of many failures. I
hearby dedicate this software to them.

## Hardware Used

The MSP430G2253 was used as the microprocessor for this machine. It is rigged
up to a digital speaker, two motors, and the Game Cube controller. Pin
configurations are available in the relevant header files for each of the three
subsystems.
